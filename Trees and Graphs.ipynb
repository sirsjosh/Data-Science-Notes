    "# Binary Search Trees (BST)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search Trees (BSTs) are hierarchical data structures that allow for efficient storage and retrieval of sorted data. Each node in a BST has at most two children (left and right), with the left child containing values less than the node's value and the right child containing values greater than the node's value. This property enables quick search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='bst.gif'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorted Order:** BSTs maintain elements in sorted order, making them ideal for searching and range queries.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Balanced Structure:** Ideally, BSTs are balanced to ensure logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Recursive Definition:** Each subtree of a BST is also a BST, following the same properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion:** Adding a new element to a BST involves comparing it with nodes and traversing left or right based on the comparison until a suitable position is found.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Search:** Searching for a specific element in a BST is efficient, as nodes are organized based on their values, allowing for logarithmic time complexity on balanced trees.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Deletion:** Removing a node from a BST requires maintaining its structure by handling cases with zero, one, or two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Searching:** BSTs offer efficient search operations (average case O(log n)) due to their sorted structure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Structure:** BSTs can dynamically grow and shrink while maintaining their sorted order, making them suitable for dynamic datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Support for Range Queries:** BSTs facilitate range queries, allowing retrieval of elements within a specified range efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you want to store a sorted list of integers in a BST:\n",

    "# Red-Black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Red-Black Trees are self-balancing binary search trees that maintain balance through a set of rules while allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. They are designed to ensure that the height of the tree remains logarithmic, resulting in predictable and efficient performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='red-black-trees.gif'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balanced Structure:** Red-Black Trees enforce rules that keep the tree balanced, preventing it from becoming highly imbalanced and ensuring logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Coloring Scheme:** Nodes in Red-Black Trees are assigned colors (red or black) based on specific rules that govern the tree's balance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Rotation Operations:** Red-Black Trees use rotation operations (left rotation and right rotation) to maintain balance during insertion and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of Red-Black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every node is either red or black.\n",
    "2. The root node is always black.\n",
    "3. Red nodes cannot have red children (no two red nodes can be adjacent).\n",
    "4. Every path from a node to its descendant NULL nodes must have the same number of black nodes (black height).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion:** Adding a new element to a Red-Black Tree involves following the insertion rules and performing rotations as necessary to maintain balance.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Deletion:** Removing a node from a Red-Black Tree requires adjusting the tree and colors to preserve the Red-Black properties.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Search:** Searching for an element in a Red-Black Tree is similar to searching in a regular binary search tree, with the added benefit of logarithmic time complexity due to tree balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balanced Height:** Red-Black Trees guarantee balanced height, ensuring efficient performance for operations even with large datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Predictable Performance:** The self-balancing nature of Red-Black Trees results in predictable and consistent time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Red-Black Trees are commonly used in implementations of balanced search trees, associative arrays, and data structures requiring efficient dynamic operations with guaranteed logarithmic performance.\n"

    "# Tree Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree rotations are fundamental operations used in tree data structures, particularly binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and Red-Black trees. These rotations help maintain the properties of the tree, such as balance, ordering, and search efficiency, by restructuring the nodes while preserving the relative ordering of keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='tree-rotations.gif'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Tree Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Left Rotation:**\n",
    "   - Adjusts the structure so that a node becomes the left child of its right child.\n",
    "   - Used to correct imbalances in right-heavy trees and maintain the binary search tree property.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Right Rotation:**\n",
    "   - Adjusts the structure so that a node becomes the right child of its left child.\n",
    "   - Used to correct imbalances in left-heavy trees and preserve the binary search tree property.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Balancing AVL Trees:** Used during insertion and deletion to rebalance the tree and maintain height balance.\n",
    "- **Balancing Red-Black Trees:** Maintains color properties and balance during insertions and deletions.\n",
    "- **Optimizing Search Operations:** Rearranges nodes for efficient access and traversal paths.\n",
    "- **Maintaining Order:** Helps in maintaining the order of elements in sorted binary search trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of Left Rotation\n",
    "\n",

    "# Skip Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip Lists are data structures that provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees for maintaining a sorted collection of elements. They were invented by William Pugh in 1989 as a way to achieve logarithmic search time with relatively simple implementation compared to balanced trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='skip-list.gif'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probabilistic Structure:** Skip Lists use randomization to create multiple layers of nodes, with higher layers having fewer elements, allowing for efficient search operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Search Complexity:** Skip Lists offer average-case search complexity of O(log n), similar to balanced trees, making them suitable for applications requiring fast search operations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Simplified Design:** Compared to balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees, Skip Lists have a simpler design and are easier to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of Skip Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base Layer:** The bottom layer of a Skip List contains all elements in sorted order, similar to a linked list.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Additional Layers:** Each additional layer (level) contains a subset of elements from the layer below it, reducing the search space for faster lookups.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Express Lanes:** Higher layers act as \"express lanes\" that allow skipping ahead, hence the name \"Skip List.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion:** Inserting an element into a Skip List involves probabilistically determining the number of layers for the new element and updating the structure accordingly.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Search:** Searching for an element in a Skip List is efficient, utilizing the multiple layers to skip ahead and narrow down the search space.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Deletion:** Deleting an element requires adjusting pointers to remove the element from the Skip List while maintaining the structure's integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Search:** Skip Lists offer efficient search operations with average-case time complexity similar to balanced trees.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Simplicity:** Skip Lists have a simpler design compared to balanced trees, making them easier to understand and implement.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dynamic Structure:** Skip Lists can dynamically grow and shrink without expensive rebalancing operations, making them suitable for dynamic datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip Lists are commonly used in applications requiring fast search operations, such as database indexing, caches, and search algorithms.\n"
