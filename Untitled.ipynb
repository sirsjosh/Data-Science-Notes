    "<h3>Characteristics</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resizable**: Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink in size dynamically as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "2. **Contiguous Memory**: Elements in a dynamic array are stored in contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient indexing and access.\n",
    "3. **Indexed Access**: Elements in a dynamic array can be accessed using zero-based indexing, similar to arrays.\n",
    "4. **Flexible Size**: Unlike fixed-size arrays, dynamic arrays can accommodate varying numbers of elements without preallocating a specific size.\n",

    "# Min-Heap Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A min-heap is a specialized binary tree-based data structure that maintains the heap property, where every parent node has a value less than or equal to its children nodes' values. This property ensures that the minimum element is always at the root of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Tree:** Min-heaps are often represented as complete binary trees, where all levels are filled except possibly the last, which is filled left to right.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Heap Property:** In a min-heap, every parent node has a value less than or equal to its children nodes' values, making the root node the minimum element in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Operations:** Min-heaps support efficient operations such as inserting elements, extracting the minimum element, decreasing key values, and maintaining the heap property through heapify operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insert Key:** Adds a new element to the min-heap while maintaining the heap property by performing a heapify-up operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extract Min:** Removes and returns the minimum element (root) of the min-heap while ensuring that the remaining elements maintain the heap property through heapify-down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decrease Key:** Decreases the value of a specific element in the heap, adjusting its position to maintain the heap property by performing a heapify-up operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-heaps are commonly implemented using arrays or linked structures. Array-based implementations are efficient and allow for easy indexing and heap property maintenance through heapify operations.\n",

    "# Heapsort Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages the properties of a heap data structure, specifically a binary heap, to efficiently sort elements in ascending or descending order. It is an in-place sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Heap Data Structure:** Heapsort utilizes the properties of a heap, such as the heap property (min-heap or max-heap), to perform sorting efficiently.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **In-Place Sorting:** Heapsort sorts elements in-place within the given array without requiring additional memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** Heapsort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases, making it suitable for sorting large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Heap Construction:** Initially, the input array is transformed into a heap, typically a max-heap for ascending order or a min-heap for descending order.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Sorting Phase:** During the sorting phase, the largest (for max-heap) or smallest (for min-heap) element is repeatedly extracted from the heap and placed at the end of the array, effectively building the sorted portion of the array from the end towards the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Heap Adjustment:** After each extraction, the heap is adjusted to maintain the heap property (heapify down for max-heap or heapify up for min-heap), ensuring that the next largest/smallest element is extracted in the subsequent iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Sorted Array:** Once all elements have been extracted and placed in their correct positions, the array becomes fully sorted in ascending or descending order, depending on the type of heap used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an unsorted array [10, 5, 8, 3, 9, 12] that we want to sort in ascending order using heapsort.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Heap Construction:\n",
    "   - Convert the array into a max-heap: [12, 9, 10, 3, 5, 8]\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Sorting Phase:\n",
    "   - Extract the largest element (12) and place it at the end: [8, 9, 10, 3, 5, | 12]\n",
    "   - Adjust the heap: [10, 9, 8, 3, 5]\n",
    "   - Repeat the process until all elements are sorted: [3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Final Sorted Array: [3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12]\n",
    "\n",
    "Heapsort efficiently sorts the array in ascending order while leveraging the heap data structure's properties and maintaining a time complexity of O(n log n).\n"

    "# Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables are data structures that store key-value pairs and allow for efficient retrieval and insertion of elements based on their keys. They use a hash function to map keys to indexes within an underlying array, providing constant-time average case complexity for basic operations like insertion, retrieval, and deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./hashtable.gif'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashing:** Hash tables use a hash function to convert keys into indices within an array, allowing for quick access to values associated with keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key-Value Storage:** Each element in a hash table consists of a key-value pair, where the key is used for indexing and the value is the data associated with that key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collision Handling:** Hash tables employ collision resolution techniques (e.g., chaining or open addressing) to handle cases where different keys hash to the same index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Insertion:** Adding a key-value pair to the hash table involves hashing the key to determine its index and storing the value at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retrieval:** Retrieving a value associated with a given key entails hashing the key to find its corresponding index and returning the value stored at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deletion:** Removing a key-value pair from the hash table involves hashing the key to locate its index and then removing the element at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fast Lookup:** Hash tables offer constant-time average case complexity for basic operations, making them ideal for applications requiring quick lookups and retrievals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Key Types:** Hash tables can handle a wide range of key types, including integers, strings, objects, and custom data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you want to implement a dictionary-like data structure to store employee information using a hash table. Each employee's ID (key) maps to their corresponding details (value), such as name, department, and salary.\n",
